# SEO-API-Project | YouTube Channel Finder
## Function
* Search for YouTube Channel and print statistics about the channel.
* You can find subscriber, video and total view count.

## Instructions
* Run the application
* When prompted, input the ID/Channel Name of the channel you wish to search.
* Press Enter to submit

## Other Notes
* The YouTube API is fairly inconsistent when it comes to searching channels by name. For example, if there is a space in the name, you may not be able to search it.
  * Additionally, even name with no spaces sometimes don't search. It seems to be based on size, but the API documentation doesn't say much about it.
* Using channel ID will result in much more consistent use.
